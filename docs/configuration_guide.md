# Configuration Guide

This guide helps you configure the Universal Organization RAG System for your specific needs.

## üéØ Quick Configuration

### Step 1: Choose Your Template

```bash
# Copy the appropriate template
cp config_examples/startup_company.yaml config.yaml
# OR
cp config_examples/tech_company.yaml config.yaml  
# OR
cp config_examples/consulting_firm.yaml config.yaml
# OR
cp config_examples/personal_knowledge.yaml config.yaml
```

### Step 2: Basic Customization

Edit the essential fields in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
organization:
  name: "YourCompany"  # Replace with your actual organization name

data_sources:
  documentation:
    base_path: "/path/to/your/docs"  # Point to your documentation

rag_goals:
  primary_purpose: "interview_preparation"  # Choose your goal
  focus_areas:
    - "company_culture"     # Customize your focus areas
    - "team_dynamics"
```

### Step 3: Test Configuration

```bash
# Validate your configuration
python test_setup.py config.yaml

# If validation passes, run setup
./setup.sh config.yaml
```

## üìã Complete Configuration Reference

### Organization Details

```yaml
organization:
  name: "YourCompany"              # REQUIRED: Your organization name
  description: "Brief description"  # Used in collection metadata
  domain: "company.com"            # Used for identification
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use your actual organization name for `name`
- Keep `description` brief but descriptive
- `domain` helps identify the organization in multi-tenant setups

### RAG Goals Configuration

```yaml
rag_goals:
  primary_purpose: "purpose"       # REQUIRED: Main use case
  focus_areas: []                  # REQUIRED: Areas of focus
  target_role: "role"              # OPTIONAL: Specific role optimization
```

```yaml
processing:
  max_chunk_size: 1500
  chunk_overlap: 300
  batch_size: 64
  max_memory_usage: 0.85
```

**For Speed (Faster Processing):**

  batch_size: 32
```

### ChromaDB Configuration

```yaml

    keywords: ["research", "study", "analysis"]

processing:
  max_chunk_size: 800       # Smaller for personal notes
  batch_size: 20
```

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Content Categories

Add categories specific to your organization:

```yaml
content_categories:
  # Standard categories...
  
  # Custom categories
  compliance_docs:
    keywords: ["compliance", "audit", "regulation", "gdpr", "soc2"]

    importance: "high"
```

### Multi-Language Support

```yaml
processing:
  language: "en"  # Primary language

# For multiple languages, create separate configs
# or extend the system to support multiple languages
```

### Custom Embedding Models

```yaml
processing:
  # Fast and lightweight
  embedding_model: "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
  
  # Better quality, slower
  embedding_model: "all-mpnet-base-v2"
  
  # Multilingual
  embedding_model: "distiluse-base-multilingual-cased"
  
  # Domain-specific (if available)
  embedding_model: "sentence-transformers/allenai-specter"  # Scientific papers
```

## üö® Troubleshooting Configuration

### Validation Errors

**Error: "Organization name is required"**
```yaml
# Fix: Add organization name
organization:
  name: "YourCompany"  # This field is required
```

**Error: "Documentation path not found"**
```yaml
# Fix: Verify the path exists
data_sources:
  documentation:
    base_path: "/correct/path/to/your/docs"
```

**Error: "No focus areas specified"**
```yaml
# Fix: Add at least one focus area
rag_goals:
  focus_areas:
    - "company_culture"  # At least one required
```

### Performance Issues

**Memory Issues:**
```yaml
# Reduce memory usage
processing:
  batch_size: 16          # Smaller batches
  max_memory_usage: 0.7   # Lower threshold
  max_chunk_size: 800     # Smaller chunks
```

**Slow Processing:**
```yaml
# Speed up processing
processing:
  embedding_model: "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"  # Faster model
  batch_size: 64          # Larger batches
```

### Content Quality Issues

**Too Much Irrelevant Content:**
```yaml
# Better filtering
quality:
  min_content_length: 200  # Skip short files
  exclude_patterns:
    - "**/archive/**"      # Skip archived content
    - "**/old/**"          # Skip old content
    - "**/*.backup"        # Skip backup files
```

**Missing Content:**
```yaml
# More inclusive processing
quality:
  min_content_length: 50   # Lower threshold
  skip_empty_files: false  # Process all files
  file_extensions:
    - "*.md"
    - "*.txt"
    - "*.rst"              # Add more file types
```

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple
- Begin with a basic configuration
- Test with a small subset of documentation
- Gradually add complexity

### 2. Use Descriptive Names
- Choose clear organization names
- Use meaningful team names
- Make keywords specific but comprehensive

### 3. Organize Your Documentation
- Structure documentation logically
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Maintain clear directory hierarchies

### 4. Regular Updates
- Update configuration as organization evolves
- Re-run ingestion when documentation changes
- Monitor and adjust performance settings

### 5. Test Thoroughly
- Validate configuration before full setup
- Test queries after ingestion
- Verify team and category mappings
