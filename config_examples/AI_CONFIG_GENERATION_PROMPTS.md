## üõ† Best Practices for AI-Generated Configs

### ‚úÖ Do This:
1. **Be specific** about company type, size, and industry
2. **Include actual team names** from the organization
3. **Provide real documentation paths** if you have them
4. **Mention the specific role** you're interviewing for
5. **Include unique company aspects** (remote-first, open source, etc.)
6. **Ask for helpful comments** in the generated config
7. **Request optimization** for your specific use case

### ‚ùå Avoid This:
1. **Generic prompts** without specific context
2. **Assuming standard team structures** without verification
3. **Ignoring industry-specific requirements**
4. **Forgetting to validate paths** before running setup
5. **Not customizing keywords** for the company's domain
6. **Using placeholder values** in production configs

## üéØ Example AI Conversations

### Successful Prompt:
**Human**: *"I'm preparing for a Senior Product Manager interview at Stripe. They focus on payments infrastructure, have engineering, product, partnerships, and risk teams. My research docs are in /Users/alex/stripe-research. I want to understand their approach to global payments, developer experience, and platform strategy."*

**AI Response**: *[Generates comprehensive config.yaml with payments-specific keywords, fintech compliance settings, developer platform focus, and global scaling considerations]*

### Enhanced Follow-up:
**Human**: *"Great! Can you also add keywords for marketplace dynamics, two-sided networks, and API ecosystem management since Stripe connects merchants and payment processors?"*

**AI Response**: *[Updates config with marketplace-specific content categorization and two-sided network keywords]*

## üöÄ Production Tips

1. **Save your prompts** - You might need to regenerate configs
2. **Version control** your configs alongside documentation changes
3. **Test configurations** before important interviews or deployments
4. **Share successful prompts** with your team for consistency
5. **Iterate based on results** - Improve prompts based on what works
