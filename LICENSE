## ðŸŽ“ Educational Project

This project was created for educational purposes during a weekend learning session using Claude Sonnet 4. 
It demonstrates how to build a universal, configurable RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that can 
work with any organization's documentation.

**Acknowledgments:**
- Built with assistance from Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4
- Tested extensively on Apple M1/M2 hardware
- Inspired by the need for universal, organization-agnostic knowledge management tools

**Learning Objectives:**
- Universal system design and configuration management
- RAG implementation with ChromaDB and sentence transformers
- Cross-platform compatibility and Docker deployment
- Production-ready software engineering practices

This project transforms organization-specific documentation into intelligent, searchable knowledge bases 
without requiring custom development for each organization.
